# git-python-util
### This will start to automate some common git tasks.

My first goal is to write an interactive utility for untracked files. This is similar to interactive cleaning but with some added options.

Interactive options will be:
* Delete (Deletes the file from the system) 
* Ignore (which will add to the .gitignore)
* Add (will basically do a git add)
* Skip (Skip the file)

To be able to run this script (or these scripts we will see), or work on the repository first run this command.
`pip install gitpython'
